Cross-validation in hyperparameter tuning serves two main purposes:

Model Validation: Cross-validation provides a robust estimate of the model's performance on unseen data. By splitting the training data into multiple subsets (folds), the model can be trained on some folds and validated on others. This process is repeated multiple times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. The average performance across all folds gives a more reliable estimate of the model's true performance than a single train-test split.

Hyperparameter Selection: Cross-validation is used to select the best hyperparameters for the model. For each combination of hyperparameters, the model's
